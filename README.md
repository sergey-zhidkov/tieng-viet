## Installation

TBD

## How Does It Work?

Once Tiengviet is installed on your computer you'll see a little icon showing
the Tiengviet logo near the upper right-hand corner of your browser. By
clicking on this icon you can turn the extension on and off. Click on it and
wait until you see the word "On" displayed in red and white on top of the icon.
This tells you that the dictionary is active. If you want to turn it off again,
just click on the icon again and the red "On" label disappears. So with a
single mouse-click you can activate or deactivate the dictionary.

Once Tiengviet has been turned on, showing the red "On" label on the icon, you
can go to a web page in Vietnamese and point your mouse at some Vietnamese words.
A pop-up window opens up automatically showing you the translation of the word
you were pointing at.

## What Information Does It Show?

By default, the pop-up window shows the following pieces of information:

- The Vietnamese words you're pointing at with your mouse.
- The individual words are shown in
  different colors (see below).
- The English translation. Sometimes, Tiengviet finds more than one matching
  entry in its dictionary. In this case it shows you all of the matching
  entries.

## What Built-In Dictionary Does It Use?

Tiengviet comes with a recent release of the VNEDICT dictionary. This dictionary is
constantly updated, and each Tiengviet release will include an updated version of the
dictionary.
